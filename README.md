# Next 13 AppDir MUI setup

Setup to get SSR working in an AppDir setup (using [tss-react](https://tss-react.dev) tooling).  

Note that MUI components doesn't include the `"use client";` directive yet so they can only be used
in components that are themselves labeled as client. [See Next doc](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components#third-party-packages)
