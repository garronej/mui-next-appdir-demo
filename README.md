# Next 13 AppDir MUI setup

Setup to get SSR working in an AppDir setup (using [tss-react](https://tss-react.dev) tooling).  

Note that MUI components don't include the `"use client";` directive yet so they can only be used
in components that are themselves labeled as client. [See Next doc](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components#third-party-packages)  

> NOTE: This example isn't great since it happens that the MUI button renders correctly even if
> we don't go out of our way to ensure that the Emotion styles are injected in the head instead
> of the body on the server side.
> However it's not generally the case. If you want to see what the provider actually does just remove
> it, disable JavaScript and reload the page, you'll se that the MUI styles are injected inline in the body
> with the `NextAppDirEmotionCacheProvider` they are in the header.
