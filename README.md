# Next 13 AppDir MUI setup

Setup to get SSR working in an AppDir setup.  

Note that MUI components doesn't include the `"use client";` directive yet so they can only be used
in components that are themselves labeled as client. [See Next doc](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components#third-party-packages)  


```bash
git clone https://github.com/garronej/mui-next-appdir-demo
